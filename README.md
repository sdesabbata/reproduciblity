A (currently small) collection of my materials on reproducibility and open scholarship.

## Where to start?

New to reproducibility and don't know where to start? Here are my two cents...

- first, make sure you use a **text-based data format** where possible
- next, start using **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)**, e.g. taking notes with a software like [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
  - you can then move to writing documents and papers with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
  - maybe even presentations in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
  - maybe move your bibliography to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (there are export/import tools)
- then, **get coding** with with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) ([Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)), [Python](https://www.python.org/) or another languange
  - create dynamic analysis document including code in your [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document
  - create your visualisations using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or another library or languange
- finally, explore the use of **[Git](https://git-scm.com)** (e.g.,  [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)) for your own private project
  - use use of [Git](https://git-scm.com) to publish your project publically
- also, keep an eye on licences
